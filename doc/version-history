=== Version history

===== version 0.38.2

* Fix bug related to path matchers as procedures and sessions which caused errors, for example, on redirections from pages defined with path matchers as procedures to the login page


===== version 0.38.1

* Fix bug in handler for {{/reload}} when in development mode and in SXML mode
* Versions now have a second dot for bugfix releases


===== version 0.38

* Fix bug in {{define-page}} when page handlers return procedures


===== version 0.37

* Fix {{page-exception-message}} when in development mode and using SXML (thanks to sECuRE for catching that)


===== version 0.36

* SXML support.  The use of SXML mode (i.e., {{(enable-sxml #t)}} is highly encouraged.  All the documentation examples show SXML code.  Page handlers that yield strings are deprecated and support for them will be removed in future versions.
* {{++}} and {{concat}} have been decrecated (they are still available, but will be removed in future versions).
* jQuery updated to version 1.8.2


===== version 0.35

* Added {{awful-resources-table}}
* Added {{set-page-title!}} (thanks to John J. Foerch for suggesting that)

* The return value of the second argument to {{define-page}} can now be a procedure
* {{add-request-handler-hook!}} overwrites hooks with the same name instead of adding multiple copies
* {{define-page}}'s {{use-ajax}} keyword parameter can also be bound to a string indicating the path to the ajax library
* Code moved to github


===== version 0.34
* Don't check {{current-effective-user-id}} on windows, since it is not available on that platform.  Reported by Karl_H on #chicken.
* Use {{<label>}} instead of {{<span>}} for login form labels (patch by Arthur Maciel).  Warning: this change may break your login form layout if you rely on the specific {{<span>}} tags for form labels.


===== version 0.33
* jQuery updated to version 1.7.1
* Added {{session-cookie-setter}} (thanks to Thomas Hintz)
* Added {{event}} argument to anonymous javascript function given as argument to {{bind}}/{{live}} ({{ajax}} and friends).  Patch by Thomas Hintz.
* The {{method}} keyword parameter for {{define-page}} and {{ajax}} & friends can be bound to a list of methods.  Methods are now case insensitive.

===== version 0.32
* Added {{method}} keyword parameter for {{define-page}}.  Now the page router takes into account the HTTP method, so it is possible to have two different pages using the same path but different methods.
* Added {{error-handler}} keyword parameter for {{ajax}}, {{ajax-link}} and {{periodical-ajax}} (suggested by Thomas Hintz)
* {{ajax}} and friends send {{Content-Type: application/json}} when {{update-targets}} is non-#f
* {{ajax}} bugfix: only opens db connection and refresh session when the page access is allowed
* The default value for {{awful-backlog}} has been set to 100
* Updated JQuery from version 1.5.2 to 1.6.3
* Dropped {{-lambda-lift}} build option
* Added the {{reload-apps}} procedure. {{load-apps}} no longer resets the resources table
* {{awful-start}} requires a thunk as argument. With this, awful can be embedded into standalone applications


===== version 0.31
* Added a tiny wrapper around [[/egg/spiffy-request-vars|spiffy-request-vars]], adding the {{with-request-variables}} macro and exporting {{spiffy-request-vars}}'s converters.
* Updated JQuery from version 1.5.1 to 1.5.2.
* Better support for multiple applications under the same virtual host ({{add-request-handler-hook!}} and {{remove-request-handler-hook!}})
* {{$db}} checks if database access is enabled via {{(enable-db)}} and throws an error if it is not.
* Fixed critical bug regarding to parameters and thread reuse by Spiffy
* Fixed {{redirect-to}} but introduced in version 0.29

===== version 0.30
* The {{(ajax-library)}} is always linked before any other scripts and javascript code in the headers (e.g., when {{(javascript-position)}} is {{top}}).
* Ajax-related procedures simplifications and bugfix in the session awareness code when called from {{define-session-page}}.

===== version 0.29
* Updated JQuery from version 1.5.0 to 1.5.1.
* {{ajax}} and {{periodical-ajax}} bugfix (for situations when they are used simultaneously, or {{periodical-ajax}} and {{add-javascript}}).
* The default URI for {{ajax-library}} is now protocol-relative (thanks to Peter Bex).
* Added the {{javascript-position}} parameter.

===== version 0.28
* Updated JQuery from version 1.4.3 to 1.5.0.
* {{ajax}} and friends ({{periodical-ajax}}, {{ajax-link}}) are now session-aware when called from {{define-session-page}} (e.g., you don't need to explicitly pass the session identifier).
* Added the {{cache}} keyword parameter for {{ajax}}, {{ajax-link}} and {{periodical-ajax}}.
* The HTTP request variables are now parsed and made available on demand, when {{$}} is called for the first time for each request (thanks to David Krentzlin).
* Applications are no longer loaded with administrator privileges when awful is run by administrator and configured to switch to a non privileged user. For code which needs administrator privileges (like binding to low ports, IP addresses, user/group settings etc), there's a new command line option for the awful application server: {{--privileged-code}}.  '''Warning''': if you rely on your configuration performing actions with administrator privileges, this change may affect your code.
* {{define-session-page}} bug fix (it was not properly obtaining the session identifier).


===== version 0.27
* Require the {{regex}} egg, for chickens >= 4.6.2

===== version 0.26
* {{define-page}} allows page redefinitions
* Added the {{undefine-page}} procedure
* Fancy web REPL (enabled by default).  The awful application server now accepts the {{--disable-web-repl-fancy-editor}} command line option to disable the web REPL fancy editor.
* Added the following parameters, related to the fancy web REPL: {{enable-web-repl-fancy-editor}} and {{web-repl-fancy-editor-base-uri}}.
* Bug fix for the development mode: requests to the {{/reload}} path killed {{/web-repl}} and {{/session-inspector}}

===== version 0.25
* The awful application server can now be used with the {{--development-mode}} command line option, which enables the web REPL, the session inspector (when {{enable-session}} is #t) for the localhost and on-browser error messages and backtraces.  When running in development mode, the {{/reload}} path is defined to reload awful apps.
* The awful application server now supports the {{--ip-address}} and {{--port}} command line options.
* {{use-ajax}} keyword parameter for {{define-page}} (for when {{enable-ajax}} is {{#f}} and you need ajax for some specific pages only)
* Added {{awful-response-headers}} and {{development-mode?}} parameters

===== version 0.24
* initial support for storing session identifiers in cookies.  Added the {{enable-session-cookie}} and {{session-cookie-name}} parameters.  By default, cookies-sessions are enabled (relevant only when using sessions, of course). '''Warning''': if your code relies on the availability of session identifiers in the query string or in the request body for whatever reason, it will break.
* initial support for HTTP redirection via {{redirect-to}}.
* web-repl and session-inspector beautification
* web-repl and session inspector provide a {{headers}} keyword parameter
* fixes for {{define-page}} regarding to regex-based paths
* {{ajax}} always prioritizes the {{success}} keyword parameter value (when it's given) to generate code for JQuery's {{success}} attribute, even when {{target}} and {{update-targets}} are given
* awful (the application) handles the {{-v}} and {{--version}} command line options

===== version 0.23
* added the {{update-targets}} keyword parameter for {{ajax}}, {{periodical-ajax}} and {{ajax-link}} procedures (multiple targets update support)
* added the {{debug-resources}} parameter for debugging the resources table
* the {{js}} keyword parameter for {{ajax}}, {{periodical-ajax}} and {{ajax-link}} has been renamed to {{success}} (to match JQuery's API naming for Ajax). '''Warning''': if your code uses the {{js}} keyword parameter for {{ajax}}, {{periodical-ajax}} or {{ajax-link}}, this change will break your code.
* the javascript variable bound to the response data on successful ajax request has been renamed to {{response}} (it was {{h}} before). The same warning for the {{js}}->{{success}} renaming is valid for this change, since it is directly related to {{js}} (now {{success}}).
* the default value for {{main-page-path}} is now {{"/"}} (it was {{"/main"}} before).  There's no more main page redirection.  '''Warning''': if your code relies on hardcoded {{"/main"}} paths (instead of using {{(main-page-path)}}) or if you rely on the main page automatic redirection, this change will break your code.
* {{ajax}} bugfix regarding to session identifiers (could cause "Invalid session ID" errors in some cases, specially with {{define-session-page}}).
* better handling of URI paths regarding to paths as directories (see FAQ's ''How does awful bind URIs to files/directories on the filesystem and procedures?'')

===== version 0.22
* bug fix: fixed unintended shadowing of {{js}} in ajax

===== version 0.18
* support for regex-based page paths (see {{define-page}})

See [[/egg/awful-postgresql|awful-postgresql]], [[/egg/sqlite3|sqlite3]] and [[/egg/sql-de-lite|sql-de-lite]] eggs.
* Removed requirement for postgresql
* {{enable-db}} is now a procedure (not a parameter as before) and accepts no arguments

===== version 0.9
* {{login-form}} gets the {{user}} refilled when the session or passowrd is not valid.  This feature may be disabled by setting the {{refill-user}} keyword parameter for {{login-form}} to {{#f}} (default is {{#t}}).  Thanks to Arthur Maciel for suggesting this feature.
