=== Version history

===== version 1.0.4 (2025-08-24)

* CHICKEN 6 support (thanks for Pietro Cerutti)


===== version 1.0.3 (2023-04-10)

* Automatically reject (i.e., respond 404) to dangerous paths.  Dangerous paths are those that could cause a path traversal issue.

* ajax: allow using success with target/update-targets (contributed by Pietro Cerutti)


===== version 1.0.2 (2020-08-03)

* Fix typo in SXML attribute affecting JavaScript code in web-repl

===== version 1.0.1

* Fix handling of the {{--ip-address}} command line option (thanks to Vasilij Schneidermann for spotting the problem)


===== version 1.0.0

* CHICKEN 5 support
* Drop support for page handlers that produce strings ("string mode").  Now only SXML is supported.
* {{enable-sxml}} has been deprecated.  It is still available, but doesn't do anything.
* Drop dependency on the following eggs: regex, html-tags, html-utils
* The following deprecated procedures have been removed: {{++}}, {{concat}}
* New procedure: {{html-page}}


===== version 0.42.0

* Use SPIFFY_TEST_PORT environment variable's value (if provided) for tests

* Make {{awful-start}} properly honor the {{dev-mode?}} keyword parameter. Before this change, {{development-mode-actions}} would only be called from {{load-apps}}.  So, if an application uses {{awful-start}} with {{dev-mode?}} set to {{#t}}, but doesn't call {{load-apps}}, {{development-mode-actions}} would not be called.  While at it, call {{development-mode-actions}} ''before'' evaluating the thunk for {{awful-start}}, so that the evaluated code can override the settings made by {{development-mode-actions}}.

* Bug fix for {{form}} in SXML mode. Thanks to Thomas Hintz for spotting that issue.

* {{debug-file}}: its value can now also be an output-port. {{debug}} and {{debug-pp}} will properly handle the {{debug-file}} value types: filenames (strings) or output port objects.

* Add {{strict}} keyword parameter for define-page and ajax & friends

For convenience, awful sloppily considered requests for files and
directories to be equivalent.  For example, if a page was defined with
a {{"/foo"}} matcher, a request for {{"/foo/"}} would be handled by
{{"/foo"}}'s handler.

That's not always desired.  For example, consider this case:

  (define-page (irregex "/[^/]*") identity)

We want to specify that, e.g., requests for {{/foo}} should be
handled, but requests for {{/foo/}} should ''not'' be handled.  However,
since awful tries to find a handler by stripping the trailing slash, a
request for {{/foo/}} would actually be handled by the handler for
{{(irregex "/[^/]*")}}, even if the regex specified that paths with a
trailing slash should not match.

To work around that inconsistency, a new keyword parameter has been
added to {{define-page}}, {{ajax}}, {{periodical-ajax}} and
{{ajax-link}}: {{strict}} (default: {{#f}}, for backward
compatibility).  If the {{strict}} keyword parameter is truthy, awful
will not try to find a handler for the requested path by removing the
trailing slash.

With this change, the format of the resources table has changed too.
Now the value part of hash table items is a pair whose car is the
resource handler and the cdr is a boolean indicating whether the
resource is "strict" or not.


===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=32298|version 0.41.0]]

* The deprecated procedure {{sql-quote}} has been removed

* Set the default value for {{$db}}'s {{default}} keyword param as {{'()}}

To be consistent with the db-support eggs for awful.

'''WARNING''': this change may break your code!  In case of an empty
result set from a query, {{$db}} will now return {{'()}} instead of
{{#f}}.

This change can be specially harmful in case you have something like

<enscript highlight=scheme>
         (or ($db "some query") "something")
</enscript>

In this example, if the query returns an empty result set, that
expression would produce:

* in older awful versions: {{"something"}}
* in awful versions with this change: {{'()}}

To work around the incompatible behaviors, you can:

* require awful 0.41.0 in you .meta file
* always provide a value for {{$db}}'s {{default}} keyword parameter


===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=30483|version 0.40.0]]

* jQuery updated to 1.11.0

===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=30336|version 0.39.2]]
* jQuery's {{on}} method support for {{ajax}} & friends
* {{use-sxml}} keyword parameter for {{define-page}} and {{ajax}} & friends take precedence over {{enable-sxml}}. {{use-sxml}} can now be used to disable SXML mode for certain pages and {{ajax}} handlers when bound to {{#f}} (thanks to Thomas Hintz for reporting that issue)
* Fix redirection to login page when in SXML mode (regression introduced by 03e4e6b9ca2378928fa35c5b8b68738561010aa2 in 0.39.1). Thanks to Thomas Hintz for reporting that and suggesting removing html-tags code

===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=27510|version 0.36]]

* SXML support.  The use of SXML mode (i.e., {{(enable-sxml #t)}} is highly encouraged.  All the documentation examples show SXML code.  Page handlers that yield strings are deprecated and support for them will be removed in future versions.

* The return value of the second argument to {{define-page}} can now be a procedure
* {{add-request-handler-hook!}} overwrites hooks with the same name instead of adding multiple copies
* {{define-page}}'s {{use-ajax}} keyword parameter can also be bound to a string indicating the path to the ajax library
* Code moved to GitHub


===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=25890|version 0.34]]
* Don't check {{current-effective-user-id}} on windows, since it is not available on that platform.  Reported by Karl_H on #chicken.
* Use {{<label>}} instead of {{<span>}} for login form labels (patch by Arthur Maciel).  Warning: this change may break your login form layout if you rely on the specific {{<span>}} tags for form labels.


===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=25689|version 0.33]]
* jQuery updated to version 1.7.1
* Added {{session-cookie-setter}} (thanks to Thomas Hintz)
* Added {{event}} argument to anonymous JavaScript function given as argument to {{bind}}/{{live}} ({{ajax}} and friends).  Patch by Thomas Hintz.

===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=25073|version 0.32]]
* Added {{method}} keyword parameter for {{define-page}}.  Now the page router takes into account the HTTP method, so it is possible to have two different pages using the same path but different methods.

* Updated jQuery from version 1.4.3 to 1.5.0.
* {{ajax}} and friends ({{periodical-ajax}}, {{ajax-link}}) are now session-aware when called from {{define-session-page}} (i.e., you don't need to explicitly pass the session identifier).
* Added the {{cache}} keyword parameter for {{ajax}}, {{ajax-link}} and {{periodical-ajax}}.
* The HTTP request variables are now parsed and made available on demand, when {{$}} is called for the first time for each request (thanks to David Krentzlin).
* Applications are no longer loaded with administrator privileges when awful is run by administrator and configured to switch to a non privileged user. For code which needs administrator privileges (like binding to low ports, IP addresses, user/group settings, etc.), there's a new command line option for the awful application server: {{--privileged-code}}.  '''Warning''': if you rely on your configuration performing actions with administrator privileges, this change may affect your code.
* {{define-session-page}} bug fix (it was not properly obtaining the session identifier).


===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=20689|version 0.27]]

* Fancy web REPL (enabled by default).  The awful application server now accepts the {{--disable-web-repl-fancy-editor}} command line option to disable the web REPL fancy editor.
* Added the following parameters, related to the fancy web REPL: {{enable-web-repl-fancy-editor}} and {{web-repl-fancy-editor-base-uri}}.
* Bug fix for the development mode: requests to the {{/reload}} path killed {{/web-repl}} and {{/session-inspector}}

===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=19496|version 0.25]]
* The awful application server can now be used with the {{--development-mode}} command line option, which enables the web REPL, the session inspector (when {{enable-session}} is #t) for the localhost and on-browser error messages and backtraces.  When running in development mode, the {{/reload}} path is defined to reload awful apps.
* The awful application server now supports the {{--ip-address}} and {{--port}} command line options.
* {{use-ajax}} keyword parameter for {{define-page}} (for when {{enable-ajax}} is {{#f}} and you need ajax for some specific pages only)
* Added {{awful-response-headers}} and {{development-mode?}} parameters

===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=18903|version 0.24]]
* initial support for storing session identifiers in cookies.  Added the {{enable-session-cookie}} and {{session-cookie-name}} parameters.  By default, cookies-sessions are enabled (relevant only when using sessions, of course). '''Warning''': if your code relies on the availability of session identifiers in the query string or in the request body for whatever reason, it will break.

* web-repl and session-inspector beautification
* web-repl and session inspector provide a {{headers}} keyword parameter

* added the {{debug-resources}} parameter for debugging the resources table
* the {{js}} keyword parameter for {{ajax}}, {{periodical-ajax}} and {{ajax-link}} has been renamed to {{success}} (to match jQuery's API naming for Ajax). '''Warning''': if your code uses the {{js}} keyword parameter for {{ajax}}, {{periodical-ajax}} or {{ajax-link}}, this change will break your code.
* the JavaScript variable bound to the response data on successful ajax request has been renamed to {{response}} (it was {{h}} before). The same warning for the {{js}}->{{success}} renaming is valid for this change, since it is directly related to {{js}} (now {{success}}).
* the default value for {{main-page-path}} is now {{"/"}} (it was {{"/main"}} before).  There's no more main page redirection.  '''Warning''': if your code relies on hardcoded {{"/main"}} paths (instead of using {{(main-page-path)}}) or if you rely on the main page automatic redirection, this change will break your code.
* {{ajax}} bugfix regarding to session identifiers (could cause "Invalid session ID" errors in some cases, specially with {{define-session-page}}).
* better handling of URI paths regarding to paths as directories (see FAQ's ''How does awful bind URIs to files/directories on the filesystem and procedures?'')

===== [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/awful?action=show&rev=17346|version 0.13]]
* Session-aware {{link}} and {{form}} procedures.  Bug fix for {{ajax-link}} (was not passing the {{class}} keyword argument to <a>).
